Originally its a Youtube audio player that was reworked for my alarm clock.

Found a couple issues when using the Pafy import.


This one took me a couple tries.

First change within the below file:

alarmclockyt\venv\Lib\site-packages\youtube_dl\extractor\youtube.py

In my file found it on line  1794


Old
            'uploader_id': self._search_regex(r'/(?:channel|user)/([^/?&#]+)', owner_profile_url, 'uploader id') if owner_profile_url else None,
New:
            'uploader_id': self._search_regex(r'/(?:channel/|user/|@)([^/?&#]+)', owner_profile_url, 'uploader id', default=None),

Second change within the below file:

alarmclockyt\venv\Lib\site-packages\pafy\backend_youtube_dl.py

lines 53 and 54:

Old:

self._likes = self._ydl_info['like_count']
self._dislikes = self._ydl_info['dislike_count']

New:
self._likes = self._ydl_info.get('like_count',0)
self._dislikes = self._ydl_info.get('dislike_count',0)
